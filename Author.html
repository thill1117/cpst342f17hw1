  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello, my name is Tim Hill and I am 26 years old. I work for UTC Aerospace Systems as an IT Business Partner which is allowing me to return to school to finish my degree. When not working, I love to spend time with my family and whenever I can, I love to travel. With that said, I would like for you to meet my family below (Mila, Mommy, Madi and Me):</p>

  <p>I do have some experience with web programming but I still consider myself a beginner. I started back in 2013 with a course at my local community college. Since then, I have audited tons of different content using MOOCs and even managed to build a website using SquareSpace with almost zero programming. One of the platforms, I like to use is Freecodecamp.com. The ultimate goal is to improve my skills so that I can start a web design business someday. </p>
