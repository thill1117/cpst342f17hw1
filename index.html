        <p>Hello and welcome to my first webpage for CPST 342. So far I am loving the way this course is being taught. I've gone thru each example in the book and I'm surprised at how much I already know about HTML. I am really looking forward to learning JavaScript.  </p>

        <p> My expectations for this course is to learn and memorize as much of this stuff as possible. I've been playing around on the Google Dev page lately and noticed that I love design. Well, I actually love the thought of design. Hopefully, I can master these topics with the help of you!</p>
